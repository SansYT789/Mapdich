[{"newupdate":"Version update log:
• Added refresh button, now you can click to fix the error of not showing the frame or redo the frame to see the new addon
• Added "Update" feature from now on you will not need to download using links from app related pages, just go to the app and go to the link and download! (Beta)
• Removed the option to add a frame with weather plus advertising apps because it made all other frames unscrollable!
• Removed the search bar because it caused the app to crash constantly and made it impossible to search for addons!
• Added a new option called "Music Pickers", this option will help you listen to music by putting music files into the app to play music! (there are music options in the settings)
• Added option to see what's in the update!

In the future or later version:
• In the upcoming version, addon images will be turned into M images, but in return, the mb will be reduced. If left, it may be increased! (please give me your opinion on this!)
• In the future we will add music playback when entering the app (this option depends on your opinion!)
• And give us some new ideas to help this app improve!"}]
